# Rently

---

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement:
Managing rental properties manually can be inefficient, leading to delays in rent payments, difficulty tracking maintenance requests, and miscommunication between landlords and tenants. Our Tenant & Rent Management System aims to streamline the rental management process, ensuring smooth interactions between landlords and tenants while automating essential tasks.

### Solution:
A MERN stack web application that allows landlords to manage properties, collect rent online, track maintenance requests, and send automated payment reminders.

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js (REST API)  
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas  
- **Authentication:** JWT  
- **Payments:** PayPal, PhonePe  
- **Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)
