Rently
________________________________________
Project Overview
Problem Statement:
Managing rental properties manually can be inefficient, leading to delays in rent payments, difficulty tracking maintenance requests, and miscommunication between landlords and tenants. Our Tenant & Rent Management System aims to streamline the rental management process, ensuring smooth interactions between landlords and tenants while automating essential tasks.
Solution:
A MERN stack web application that allows landlords to manage properties, collect rent online, track maintenance requests, and send automated payment reminders.
Tech Stack:
•	Frontend: React.js
•	Backend: Node.js + Express.js (REST API)
•	Database: MongoDB Atlas
•	Authentication: JWT
•	Payments: PayPal, PhonePe
•	Hosting: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)
